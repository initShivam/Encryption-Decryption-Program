# Encryption-Decryption-Program
# 🔐 Encryption-Decryption CLI Tool

A simple command-line encryption and decryption tool built with Python, perfect for beginners looking to practice core concepts like loops, conditionals, lists, and functions.

## 🚀 What This Project Does

This project allows users to **encrypt** or **decrypt** messages by shifting characters through a custom alphabet. It's based on a basic Caesar Cipher-like logic with a personalized twist — a `'0'` is added to the alphabet for extra flavor!

---

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Lists & indexing
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Conditional logic (`if-elif-else`)
- Function creation and parameter passing
- User input handling
- String manipulation

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. User chooses to `encrypt` or `decrypt`.
2. User inputs a message and a shift amount.
3. Each character is shifted forward or backward in a custom-defined alphabet list.
4. Characters not in the alphabet (like spaces or punctuation) remain unchanged.

### 🧪 Example

```plaintext
Input:
Message: hello
Shift: 3

Encrypting...
Output: khoor
